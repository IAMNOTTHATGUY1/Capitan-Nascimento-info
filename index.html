                        <h2>Life leading up to the movie (1987-1997) </h2>
                        <p>Nascimento joined the military police (policia federal) of Rio de Janerio on Febuary 2, 1987 as an student officer at the Dom João VI Military Police Academy, and was declared as an Aspring officer in December 1989. In 1997,<br> Nascimento headed BOPE's Alpha Team. He had been in the service of the Military Police of the State of Rio de Janeiro for 10 years and showed signs of stress. This is worsened with the news of the up-coming birth of his first child, Rafael.</br><br>

                <section><h2>Movie events (1997-2009)</h2>
                <p>Nascimento's task is to sucure the Turano neighborhood before Pope John Paul II's arrival at the Archbishop's home near the Favela (or the slum).<br> There would be various operiations in the Favelas. Due to the death of Neto (also know as 06) a close friend of Matias causes Nascimento and other B.O.P.E officers make daliy incursions into Baiano's territory (being the trafficker who killed Neto)<br> capturing and torturing several dealers to reveal his whereabouts. BOPE interrogates several of the locals before finally locating and cornering Baiano; due to Baiano's pleas to not hurt his face for the wake.<br> Nascimento orders André to summarily execute him with a shotgun shot to the face, both as revenge for Neto's death and as a final rite of passage for B.O.P.E.</br> <br>13 years following the events of the first movie the now Lieutenant Colonel Nascimento is ambushed while leaving a hospital. While his car is sprayed with bullets, his voiceover narrates the events leading up to that point. Four years prior, Nascimento arrives at Bangu Penitentiary Complex to quell a riot started by gangleader Beirada. Diogo Fraga, a teacher and human rights activist and married to Nascimento's ex-wife Rosane, was sent to negotiate and quell the riot peacefully. Fraga is escorted to the place and convinces Beirada to release the hostages, but Nascimento's protégé, Captain André Matias, shoots Beirada against Nascimento's orders, which results in multiple inmate deaths.

            Nascimento learns that <abbr title="Military Police of Rio de Janeiro">PMERJ</abbr> commander Formoso plans to dismiss him due to the bad publicity and confronts him in a restaurant, only to be cheered by other diners for his tough line. Rio de Janeiro's State Secretary for Public Safety Guaracy seizes the opportunity and promotes Nascimento as undersecretary, but transfers Matias back to the PMERJ as a scapegoat. Nascimento promises Matias his help, but Matias informs journalist Clara Vidal of governmental corruption and lack of support for BOPE, leading to a month of jail and the estrangement between Nascimento and Matias. Fraga is elected to Rio's State Assembly.<br>
            Using his power as undersecretary, Nascimento expands BOPE's arsenal, personnel, armored vehicles and a helicopter, enabling them to eliminate entire drug cartels from favelas, hoping this will reduce police corruption. Although drug trafficking has been severely reduced, this did not reduce police corruption. Frustrated in the lack of bribe money and inspired by the gangs protection racket, Major Rocha and his dirty cops to form a police militia and takes over the gangs' land, establishing an extortion racket in the business. They also built a political machine where the Governor, Guaracy and a Federal Representative allied with Rocha.
            Four years later, Rocha's militia has nearly taken over all of West Rio. Fraga attempts to investigate but the corrupt government impedes them. Issues arises with Rafa, Nascimento's son where he gotten disobedient with both his fathers and taking drugs.</br><br>
            Disguised militiamen steal rifles from a police station in Tanque, one of the last drug strongholds, giving their corrupt allies a pretext to demand the authorities expel the heavily armed dealers, allowing the militia to take over. Nascimento listens to phonetaps of dealers and assures Guaracy they are uninvolved; however, corrupt Lieutenant-Colonel Fabio Barbosa claims an informant has implicated them and the raid is authorized. Matias, returned to BOPE by Rocha, occupies the station and ambushes the fleeing dealers, torturing captured drugleader Pepa to learn where the stolen weapons are. As Rocha arrives and inexplicably shoots Pepa, Matias confronts him, but is shot and killed by Rocha's men.
            Devastated by Matias' death, Nascimento, aware Fraga has been investigating the militia, taps his phone. Vidal, also investigating, enters one of Rocha's favelas and finds the Governor's re-election material. She phones Fraga but is caught by Rocha's group, who kill her and her photographer. Nascimento listens to the call, realizes Fraga is now a target, takes the recording and goes after him; as he waits outside Fraga's building, Fraga, Rafael and Rosane arrive and are attacked in a drive-by shooting. Nascimento shoots the assailant, but Rafael is wounded. They take him to the hospital and Nascimento hands the recording to Fraga, whereupon he detains and assaults Guaracy, threatening to kill everyone involved if his son dies.</br><br>
            The Assembly opens an investigation into the journalists' disappearances based on the recording delivered by Fraga. However, Nascimento is accused of tapping Fraga's phone to spy on Rosane, forcing his resignation. Believing his militia will be scapegoats, Rocha attempts to ambush him after a visit to Rafael; however, Nascimento, expecting an attack, is aided by BOPE officers. They shoot some of the assailants, but Rocha escapes.
            Nascimento is called to testify and implicates the Governor, Guaracy and many other individuals such as Gregorio Fortunato, a legislator and TV host who supported the militia, as many corrupt officers and associates are murdered to prevent them from testifying. The Governor, however, is re-elected and Guaracy becomes representative for Rio. The final scene shows Nascimento reflecting over the political scenario in Brazil and stating that "as long as the conditions for the system remain, it will remain". He visits Rafael as he slowly wakes from his coma.</br></br>
